## Installation

To get started with Scratchpad locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwmuni/js-widget-collection.git
   cd js-widget-collection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your browser to view the project.

4. **Build for production**

   To build the project for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized files will be output to the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to explore the different JavaScript widgets. Each widget is displayed within a card and includes an optional "Show Code" button to view the source code in a modal.

### Adding New Widgets

To add new widgets:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `src/` directory.
2. Implement your widget using CreateJS or any other preferred library.
3. Update the `index.html` file to include a new card for your widget, referencing the new JavaScript file and corresponding canvas element.

### Code Structure

- **src/**: Contains source JavaScript and CSS files.
- **dist/**: Contains the built and bundled files ready for production.
- **public/**: Public assets and additional scripts.
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts.
